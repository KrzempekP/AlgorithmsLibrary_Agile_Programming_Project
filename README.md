# AlgorithmsLibrary_Agile_Programming_Project

## Description:
Library for Java, that will utilize algorithms. 
Like: Bubble Sort, Radix Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Bucket Sort, Counting-sort, Insertion Sort, Heap Sort, Binary Search Tree, Shell Sort. 
After creating the sorting algorithms we will implement graphic display.


## Classes:
### Utility Class
#### Description: 
Simple utilty class for speeding up coding and improving clarity of code in the project.
It contains methods like: printArray(int[] array).
#### Methods: 
printArray(int[] array) - it is used to print out arrays after sorting or any other operations. 

### quickSort Class
#### Description:  
Main class for quickSort algorithm (QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.)
It cotains method for sorting the array, and parrtition in array which it is used to choose pivot and then place smaller elements on left and greater on right.
